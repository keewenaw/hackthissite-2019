<h2><b>The Guide</b></h2>

When we start the challenge, here's what we see:

So that really doesn't tell us much. Pretty disappointing. Let's view the page source to see if we find anything useful.

Awesome, so we see there's a private music collection somewhere. That tells us there's a hidden directory we need to find. 

If we refresh the page, we see that the (what I'm guessing are) song names vary on each refresh. A few I've gotten include:
<ul>
  <li>"The Cage"</li>
  <li>"Amoreena"</li>
  <li>"The Captain and the Kid"</li>
  <li>"From Denver to L.A."</li>
</ul>

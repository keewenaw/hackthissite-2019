When we start the challenge, here's what we see:

They gave us a humongous hint in the challenge intro. The developer intended to check what we input against a password file, but they never actually uploaded the file. So rather than give you the answer directly, let me ask this: what should you compare a nonexistent file or string to - nothing, something, or everything? Said another way, what's best to compare with nothing? Don't overthink it! And you definitely won't need any tools beyond a simple web browser.

When you figure it out, input your "answer" into the form field and let's see what happens!

That did it! I already completed this challenge without capturing a screenshot, so your message will be slightly different.

Challenge complete!

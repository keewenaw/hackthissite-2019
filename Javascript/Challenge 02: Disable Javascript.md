Well, it pretty clearly says the problem - we didn't disable Javascript. So let's do that. In Firefox, you can navigate to <b>about:config</b>, then search for the string "javascript.enabled". Double-click the resulting line, and the <b>value</b> field should switch to "false".

I had to restart the browser for this change to take effect. After we did that, we see the following message: "Click here to win."

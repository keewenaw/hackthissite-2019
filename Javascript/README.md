# README for HackThisSite Javascript Challenges

<i>If you haven't already, please review my terms and conditions <a href="https://github.com/keewenaw/hackthissite-2019/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">here</a>.</i>

This folder is for the HackThisSite.org "Javascript" penetration testing challenges. You can visit the challenges at the following URL: https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/javascript/

You can (usually, not always) complete a challenge by finding the password and inputting it into the form field. With these, I'll be focusing on how to find the password rather than just outright giving it to you, when practical. That way you'll learn the basics of analyzing Javascript code and be able to replicate the strategy yourself when faced with similar challenges. That's quite a bit more useful than just giving you the answers yourself.

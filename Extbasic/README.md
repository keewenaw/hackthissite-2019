# README for HackThisSite Extbasic Challenges

This folder is for the HackThisSite.org "Extbasic" penetration testing challenges. You can visit the challenges at the following URL: https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/Extbasic/

You complete a challenge by inputting one of the following: your fixed line of code into the form field, a passwored, or exploit. Each challenge will tell you the details. With these, I'll be focusing on the process of finding the solution. That means that while I'll be giving you a lot of hints (usually in the form of questions and links), I won't outright give you the solution if I can help it. That way you'll learn the basics of analyzing code and be able to replicate the strategy yourself when faced with similar challenges. That's quite a bit more useful than just giving you the answers.
